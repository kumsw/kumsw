### Hi there, I'm Kunmi

I'm a full stack Software Engineer with a passion for building products for people. 

A little about me..
* I first wrote code at university. Where I used R Studio for data visualisation of CO2 emissions.
* Post uni: I led digital marketing at a clean energy start-up. 
* In the middle of the pandemic, I took the leap into tech with the [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/ "School Of Code Homepage") 16 week Bootcamp.
* In March 2021 I landed my first role as a Software Engineer.
