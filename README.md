### Hi there, I'm Kunmi

I'm a full stack Software Developer who has recently graduated from a 16 week full time, intensive programming bootcamp at the [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/ "School Of Code Homepage").

A little about me..
* I first used code for data visualisation of CO2 emissions at university.
* Post uni: I led digital marketing at a clean energy start-up. 
* Now i'm taking a leap into tech at the School of Code Bootcamp. 

ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on:<br/>
      - My final group project! My team have 4 weeks to create an application that improves remote teaching delivery.<br/>
      
ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning: <br/> 
      - React Testing Library <br/>
      - Web Speech API<br/>

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:<br/> 
      - How to build a translation application - I'm Nigerian ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬  but unfortunately. I can't speak my mother tounge, a dream goal of mine is to build a Yoruba to    English translation app.
